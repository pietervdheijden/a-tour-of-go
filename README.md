# A Tour of Go

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).

All solutions are in file `main.go`.

To run an exercise:

- Uncomment the corresponding function in function `main()` in file `main.go` (e.g. `methods24()`).
- Execute in Bash:

```bash
go run .
```
